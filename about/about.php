              <p><strong style="color:#ff4dc1;">NAYI ASHAYEIN</strong> is a Lucknow- based nonprofit organization spanning the area that dedicates itself to bringing positive change into this life of marginalized and unprivileged people, especially children. This journey started with a social purpose to offer the brightest of futures for those who need it most. We aim at empowering the disadvantaged, especially children in orphanages by giving them life necessities such as education and food. A group of volunteers works earnestly to ensure that these children are raised in a suitable environment. In the areas such as education, women empowerment, food and nutritional security and environmental sustainability we make an attempt to develop a society that is more inclusive. </p>
